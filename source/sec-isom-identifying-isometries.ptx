    <title>What do we know? What do we wonder?</title>
    <!--<introduction>-->
        <p>
                As we continue to build on our knowledge of isometries, 
                it is wise to summarize what we know so far. 
                We know that a transformation of a plane is a mapping or function 
                that sends each point <m>P</m> on the
                plane to a unique point <m>P'</m> called its image under the 
                transformation. Some transformations are 
                <term>collineations</term>, meaning that if a set of 
                points all lie on the same line, then their images will also lie on 
                a single line. 
                We have observed that some collineations preserve shape and angle 
                measure and that some collineations 
                that preserve angle measure will also preserve distance. 
                The transformations that preserve all of these, 
                collinearity, angle measure, and distance, are called <term>isometries</term>.

    <title>Isometry Between Congruent Figures</title>
    <p>
        We are familiar with three types of isometries: reflections, 
        translations, and rotations. Yet many questions remain: 
        Are there other types of isometries? 
        Are there transformations that are not isometries? If two figures are congruent, 
        is there always an isometry mapping one to the other? If so, how do we 
        determine what type of isometry it is? 
    </p>
    <p>
        Although we have not proved this fact, it is true that if we have two congruent figures,
        there will be an isometry that maps one onto the other. 
        Our goal in this section and next will be to identify the type of isometry 
        that takes one figure onto a congruent copy. Is it a reflection, a translation, 
        a rotation, or something else? Then having determined the type can we specify 
        the exact action that performs the movement. A good place to start is to 
        identify whether the isometry maintains orientation.

                  the front face and gray cardboard on the back. We can think of the action of an isometry

                  Which isometries--reflections, translations, and rotations--

                  <m>\Delta A'B'C'</m>? How do you know whether the isometry is a rotation? Could it be both? or 
                  neither?

        Another way to distinguish between isometries is to note which points,
        if any, are unmoved by the isometry. Such a point is called a <term>fixed

      <conclusion>
        <p>
          Like the function <m>f(x)=x</m> you may have encountered in another
          course, there is a transformation of the plane that maps every point to 
          itself. We call this transformation, the <term>identity transformation</term>.
          Under the action of the identity transformation, every point is a fixed point.
          Clearly, the identity function also preserves distance, angle measure, and 
          orientation since it leaves everything unchanged.

      <title>Defining Objects of Isometries</title>
        <p>
          Once we determine whether the isometry mapping one 
          figure onto a congruent image is a reflection, translation,
          or rotation, we need to specify which reflection, which 
          translation, or which rotation it is. We do this by identifying 
          the defining object(s) of the isometry. With a reflection, for example,
          we should specify which line we are
          reflecting across. <xref ref="table-def-obj-1"/> lists the defining 
          objects for the three isometries we have studied.

            objects. As you work through <xref ref="expl-isom-finding-defining-objects"/>

                    To measure an angle on GeoGebra, be sure to click the vertex of  
                    the angle second. For example, <m>m\angle BAF</m> would be found 
                    using the angle tool and clicking <m>B</m>, <m>A</m>, and <m>F</m>
                    in that counterclockwise order. If you click the vertices in the 
                    clockwise order, you will get <m>360-\angle BAF</m>.

                    GeoGebra tools will allow you to find perpendicular lines, 
                    perpendicular bisectors, angle bisectors, circles, angle measures, 
                    and lengths. Any ideas of what we might try?

        In <xref ref="table-def-obj-1"/>, the definining objects for each transformation 
        were given. We now add new columns to this table. In the column, 
        <term>Orientation</term>, write either <sq>changes</sq>
        or <sq>maintains</sq> for the entries. The column, <term>Fixed Points
        </term> is where you will identify the point(s), if any, that are fixed 
        by the transformation, and in the column
        <term>Properties of Object(s)</term>, is 
        where you should write the properties that can assist you in locating the
        defining object(s) for each type of transformation.
