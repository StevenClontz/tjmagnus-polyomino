    <title>Exploring Area</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            In these activities we will determine the area formulas for three 
            shapes, a parallelogram, a triangle, and a trapezoid. Our goal 
            will be not only to use the formulas but more importantly to be  
            able to explain why they follow from the basic principles. In 
            particular, we will use the formula for the area of a rectangle,
            <m>A=\ell\times w</m>, as our starting point and derive other 
            area formulas from it.

                Use a combination of words and pictures to explain how it

                must work for all parallelograms.

                pictures. These lengths should stay the same throughout your 
                explanation and clarify the relationship between your parallelogram

        <title>The Area of a Triangle</title>

        <title>Discovering the Area Formula for a Triangle</title>
        <introduction>
            <p>
                You probably remember the angle formula for a triangle; in fact, you 
                may have used it already in this course! But why is the area

                    To demonstrate WHY the formula, <m>A(tri)=\frac{1}{2}bh</m>, 
                    gives the area for any triangle, construct a parallelogram 
                    based on the triangle shown below. How is the area of your 
                    parallelogram related to the area of the triangle? Explain.

                        Resist the urge to use numbers instead of the variables,
                        <m>b</m> and <m>h</m>. Specific triangles will have numerical  
                        dimensions, but we want a formula that will work for all triangles, 
                        not just the one you have. Variables allow us to generalize formulas.

                    between the triangle and the parallelogram needs to be made explicit
                    as well. Do they have the same height and base? Why or why not? Why 
                    must their areas be related and how?

                                they were constructed. Label them with the appropriate variable to

                                to give these lengths new, different labels. If you find that you need to create a lot 
                                of new labels, you might want to use a different construction or deconstruction
                                to reduce the amount of algebra you will need to do later.

                                base, and/or summit. For example, if you split the base into three segments, 
                                labeled <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>, you would write down the relationship

                                congruent to the summit, you might write <m>x+b_1=b_2</m> or equivalently,

                                may be different than the variables in the standard formulas. For example, if you
                                created an upside-down triangle, its base may be the summit of the trapezoid, and 
                                so we would use the label <m>b_1</m> (or <m>a</m>) instead of <m>b</m>.

            Thoughts on Area
        </title>
        <p>
            Adding the formula <m>A=\frac{1}{2}(b_1+b_2)h</m> for the area of a 
            trapezoid, we now have four area formulas in our tool box. One could 
            continue to add more: kites, pentagons, hexagons, etc., but 
            the list would become unwieldly and unhelpful. 
            <idx><h>trapezoid</h><h>area</h></idx>
            <idx><h>area</h><h>of a trapezoid</h></idx>
            Instead, we will  
            simply break other polygonal shapes into triangles, parallelograms, 
            and other shapes so that we can compute the area of these and add 
            (or subtract) the areas as appropriate. Measuring tools could 
            be used to estimate the dimensions needed to compute the area 
            of physical spaces such as floorspace or a garden.

                Archimedes (287-212 BC) determined the area of a circle by looking at inscribed and 
                circumscribed polygons. As the number of sides grew, the area of the polygons would 
                approach the area of the circle, with the area of the inscribed polygons giving a lower 
                estimate and the area of the circumscribed polygons giving an overestimate. The number  
                <m>\pi</m> was not known at the time, but this method provides a means of calculating 
                <m>\pi</m> to any level of precision. Note that <m>\pi\neq 3.14</m>. The value <m>3.14</m>
                is only a rough estimate. In fact, mathematicians have now calculated over sixty 
                trillion digits for <m>\pi</m>.  For our purposes, <m>\pi\approx 3.14159...</m> should 
                be sufficient, but space travel engineers usually need about 40 digits of <m>\pi</m> for their 
                work.

                There are two measurements associated with a circle. In addition to area 
                which measures the interior space, we often wish to compute the length of 
                the boundary around the circle. We call this boundary length, the <term>circumference</term>
                of the circle and can think of it as the length of string needed to wrap around 
                the circle. Both area and circumference depend only on the length of the 
                circle's <term>radius</term>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A technique, similar to the one described for estimating area using 
                polygons of increasing number of sides, can be used to find the circumference 
                or distance around a circle. We give the resulting formula below.
