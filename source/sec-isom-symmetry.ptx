  <introduction>
    <p>
      Snowflakes, product logos, rose windows, mandalas: these are just a few examples of 
      symmetry in our world. While the applications to art and architecture may 
      be most obvious, scientists observe symmetry as they study the structure 
      and behavior of chemicals, plantlife, and reflected objects.

    <title>Two Types of Symmetry</title>
    <p>
      Finite two-dimensional designs, such as snowflakes and logos, may have 
      reflectional symmetry and/or rotational symmetry. <xref ref="fig-rosette1"/>
      displays a design with both reflectional and rotational symmetry.

        <p>
          A design is said to have <term>reflectional symmetry</term> if there is 
          a line such that reflecting the design across that line causes the design 
          to align perfectly with itself. This line is called a <term>line of symmetry
          </term> for the design. Each point on one side of the line of symmetry reflects 
          to a corresponding image point on the other side of the line and the image of 
          a point reflects back across the line to the original point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reflectional symmetry is also called <term>mirror symmetry</term> and a 
          line of symmetry may be called a <term>mirror</term>. It is possible for a 
          design with mirror symmetry to have multiple lines of symmetry.

        A design is said to have <term>rotational symmetry</term> if there is a 
        rotation about a point with a positive angle of less than 360 degrees that 
        maps the design onto itself. The image of the design will look identical to the original

                  As we record the result of performing symmetries on the triangle 
                  in <xref ref="GGappfortrisymm"/>, we will use the notation <m>r_0</m>, <m>r_{120}</m>,
                  <m>r_{240}</m> to represent counterclockwise rotations of 
                  0 degrees, 120 degrees, and 240 degrees about the center 
                  of the triangle.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We will also use the notation <m>m_n</m>, <m>m_p</m>, 
                  and <m>m_v</m> to denote the reflections across line <m>n</m>
                  with negative slope, line <m>p</m> with positive slope, and
                  the vertical line <m>v</m>, respectively.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because these are symmetries, the actions will always result in 
                  the same equilateral triangle. What changes is the locations of 
                  vertices <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m>.
                  Note that the image of the triangle after performing <m>r_0</m> 
                  is the same as <xref ref="fig-image-eqtrisymmgp"/>. We call this 
                  the Home Position. When using the GeoGebra applet 
                  <xref ref="GGappfortrisymm"/>, we can click on the icon in the 
                  upper right that looks like a circle with clockwise-oriented 
                  arrows to return to the Home Position.

              Like the multiplication table above, we can create a table for the 
              composition of symmetry isomorphisms on an equilateral triangle using the
              following steps as a guide. Each entry you add to the table should 
              always be one of the six symmetries of the triangle; namely,
              <m>r_0</m>, <m>r_{120}</m>, <m>r_{240}</m>, <m>m_n</m>, <m>m_p</m>, or 
              <m>m_v</m>. When you use <xref ref="GGappfortrisymm"/> to compute compositions,
              be sure to reset the triangle to home position before performing the first of 
              the two actions and then perform the second action without resetting the 
              triangle. Compare the final result to the vertex labels you recorded in 
              <xref ref="record-trisymm-images"/>.

                    Because the order of the transformations matter, we need to agree on how to 
                    place these expressions in the table. We shall agree to use the row heading as 
                    the first symmetry action performed and use the column heading for the second 
                    transformation. Write the symmetry you just found in the cell of the 
                    <m>r_{120}</m>-row and <m>m_n</m>-column. Write the symmetry from 
                    <xref ref="reflacrossn-then-rotate120"/> in the <m>m_n</m>-row and 
                    <m>r_{120}</m>-column.<fn>This order was chosen because it 
                      is more natural to fill in a row at a time and to have the row label be the 
                      first transformation. The table may differ from ones found elsewhere that 
                      adhere more closely to the order suggested by the composition functio.</fn>

                          <m>r_{120}\star m_p</m>, by first rotating the triangle in home position 
                          120 degrees counterclockwise and then reflecting the resulting 
                          triangle across line <m>p</m>, and

                    Similarly, we will complete the <m>m_n</m>-row by reflecting the home triangle 
                    across the line <m>n</m> before performing the symmetry 
                    corresponding to the column heading. Check again to make sure that no

              Refer to your completed version of <xref ref="composition-table"/>,
              as you answer the following:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Of the six symmetry transformations, <m>r_0</m>, 
                    <m>r_{120}</m>, <m>r_{240}</m>, <m>m_n</m>, <m>m_p</m>, and 
                    <m>m_v</m>, which transformation behaves like the number 1 
                    does in multiplication?  We call this transformation the 
                    <term>identity transformation</term>.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Which transformation <q>undoes</q> <m>R_{120}</m>? In other 
                    words, which transformation can you perform after <m>R_{120}</m> 
                    so that this two-step action gives the same result as the identity 
                    transformation? Does the order of these two transformations matter?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Algebra connection: How is this relationship like composing the <sq>multiply
                    by five</sq> function <m>f(x)=5x</m> and the <sq>divide by 5</sq>
                    function <m>g(y)=\frac{y}{5}</m> ?
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Which transformation <q>undoes</q> <m>m_n</m> ? Does <m>m_n</m> undo that transformation?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Algebra connection: Is there a real number <m>k</m> such that 
                    the multiplication by <m>k</m> function, <m>h(x)=kx</m>, undoes itself?
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Algebra connection: The operation multiplication on the set of real 
                    numbers satisfies the commutative property, <m>a\cdot b=b\cdot a</m> for 
                    all real numbers, <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>. Does composition of symmetry transformations 
                    satisfy the commutative property? Support your answer.
